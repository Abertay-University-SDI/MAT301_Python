# Welcome to MAT301 Numerical Methods with Python

This is a book containing a collection of Python Jupyter notebooks, designed to complement the dynamics content covered in MAT301 for undergraduate Computer Games Technology (CGT) students at Abertay University.

**Remember:** The aim of MAT301 is for you to understand and implement the mathematics of each iterative solution you have been shown. The MAT301 exam will test your ability to demonstrate the mathematical steps, on pen and paper. See    
[MAT301 MyLearningSpace pages](https://mylearningspace.abertay.ac.uk/d2l/home/27414) for more information related to the MAT301 course.

These codes are for additional context **once you are able to carry out the mathematical steps**: our ultimate goal is that you are able to create numerical schemes to solve problems for yourselves in future. These codes should **NOT** be used in the exam or replace your pen and paper approach to tutorial problems. However, I do encourage you to use these codes to verify your tutorial solutions after you have already solved the problems mathematically.
