# Summary

I hope that you have found these interactive lecture notes and code examples useful. These notebooks have been created for non-native Python programmers, and hence the examples they contain are simple, with many steps outlined in much more detail than one would expect if using these practically. It is likely that other (better/more efficient) implementations of these algorithms exist on the web; these routines are simply to give you a flavour of how we can use numerical techniques to solve problems we may encounter in future.

Feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:j.threlfall@abertay.ac.uk) if you notice problems, misspellings or have ideas that may improve these notebooks for future "iterations" of MAT301(!).
